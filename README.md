# Carrot

A pure Rust tiling Wayland compositor with zero linked C, all the way down to the kernel. Carrot aims to be a feature-complete, all-in-one compositor with native support for blur, animations, multi-GPU, tearing, and more - no scripting or external tools needed.

> [!WARNING]
> Carrot is in early development and is in its first beta. Any contributions, suggestions, or feedback are encouraged!

## Complete List of Intended Features 

### Tiling
- **Dwindle layout** with directional focus, window swapping, and split ratio control
- **Drag anywhere** - mod-drag (or a key-started grab) moves floats freely and drag-swaps tiled windows; drag-resize works on both (split ratios and column widths follow the pointer)
- **Scrolling layout** - an endless horizontal strip of columns per workspace, scrolled by focus
  - Per-workspace mode, switchable live with `set-layout` (windows re-tile with animation)
  - Columns stack windows vertically; consume/expel moves windows between columns
  - Width presets (cyclable), full-width toggle, fixed widths from mouse resize, center-focus modes
  - Any scrolling workspace stacks workspaces vertically - workspace switches slide up/down
- **Window groups** (tabbed) with a styled groupbar
- **Floating layer** with mouse drag move/resize, centering, and PiP mode
- Fullscreen (real, bordered, and borderless), pin (visible on all workspaces)
- **Force float/tile per window** via window rules - no need for apps to behave

### Workspaces
- Numbered workspaces with relative navigation
- **Workspace groups** - sets of 10, navigable within and between groups
- **Special workspaces** (named scratchpads) with toggle-and-launch behavior

### Eye Candy
- Multi-pass **Kawase blur** with per-window and per-layer control (cached blurred backdrop; noise, contrast, brightness)
- **Drop shadows** with configurable size, color, offset and falloff power
- **Rounded corners** with matching ring borders, per-window opacity, active/inactive borders
- **Dim-inactive** with animated focus transitions; rounding/shadow/dim all overridable per window rule
- **Resize crossfade** - old and new content mix while the geometry animates
- **Animations** - spring physics or easing per animation kind, named custom bezier curves, hot-reloadable
  - Animated: window open/close/move, workspace switch, layer surfaces, border color (blended in OkLab)
  - Window styles: popin, fade, slide; workspace styles: slide, slidevert, fade, slidefade, slidefadevert
  - Per-window `no-anim` and style overrides via window rules
  - The animation clock samples the moment each frame reaches glass, not when it was drawn

### Window & Layer Rules
- Match by class, title, fullscreen state, xwayland, float (regex)
- Tons of effects: opacity, float, size, center, workspace assignment, immediate (tearing), idle inhibit, rounding, blur, shadow, dim, pin, keep aspect ratio
- **Focus steal control** - let specific apps actually grab focus when they ask for it, instead of just marking urgent
- **Input redirection** - route specific keys to unfocused/offscreen windows, with redirect (background only) or passthrough (both) modes
- Layer rules: animation overrides, blur, ignore alpha threshold

### Input
- Per-device mouse configuration (accel profile, sensitivity, natural scroll)
- Configurable keyboard repeat, layout, numlock
- Keybind types: press, lock-safe, repeat, release, mouse
- **Submaps** - switchable keybind contexts

### Performance & Gaming
- **Tearing** via `wp_tearing_control_v1` with per-window `immediate` rule
- **VRR** (adaptive sync) - off, automatic, or always, per-output
- **Direct scanout** bypass for fullscreen windows
- **Multi-GPU** - cross-GPU DMA-BUF import, blit and direct import paths, explicit sync, configurable renderer skip on secondary GPUs
- **Per-output GPU assignment** - render specific displays on a selectable GPUs (e.g. iGPU for laptop screen, eGPU for gaming monitor)

### IPC
- Carrot-native JSON protocol over a single unix socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/carrot.$WAYLAND_DISPLAY.sock` - one request and one reply per line
- `burrow`, the companion CLI, for queries, dispatch, and a live `subscribe` event stream (ndjson)
- Queries: active window, workspaces, workspace groups, special workspaces, monitors, clients
- Event stream: window open/close, focus, workspace changes, monitor hotplug, fullscreen, urgent
- Dispatcher commands (exec, workspace, focus, move, resize, kill, etc.)
- **Launch-to-workspace** - spawn windows on any workspace without the need of switching to it first

### Integration
- **XWayland** support via an in-house X window manager - no external tools
- `ext-idle-notify-v1` for idle/lock management
- `wlr-layer-shell` for panels, overlays, and lock screens
- `wlr-foreign-toplevel-management` for taskbars and window switchers
- Screencopy for screenshots
- Built-in `xdg-desktop-portal` ScreenCast backend with a pure-Rust PipeWire client - screensharing needs no `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`
- Clipboard via `zwlr_data_control_v1`
- DPMS wake on input

## Configuration

Carrot uses [KDL](https://kdl.dev) for configuration, with full NixOS and Home Manager module integration.

Lua configuration is also officially supported as an opt-in alternative - KDL stays the default. It's a runtime switch (no rebuild needed), and on NixOS / Home Manager you declare it through the module.

On first run carrot writes a fully commented default config to
`~/.config/carrot/carrot.kdl` - that file doubles as the option reference,
with `CONFIG.md` as the compact index. A broken config never strands the
session: carrot starts on the built-in default and reports every parse
error (all of them, with line:col) on stderr and over IPC.

```kdl
input {
    keyboard { repeat-delay 250; repeat-rate 35 }
    mouse { accel-profile "flat" }
}

layout {
    mode "dwindle"
    gaps-in 5
    gaps-out 10
    border { width 2; active-color "#89b4fa" }
}

output "DP-3" {
    mode "2560x1440@480"
    variable-refresh-rate
    allow-tearing
}

window-rule {
    match app-id=#"^steam_app_"#
    open-floating #true
    allow-tearing #true
}

binds {
    Mod+Return { spawn "foot"; }
    Mod+F { toggle-fullscreen; }
    Mod+1 { focus-workspace 1; }
    XF86AudioMute allow-when-locked=#true { spawn "wpctl" "set-mute" "@DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@" "toggle"; }
}
```

      keyboard = { repeat_rate = 35; };
    };
  };
};
```

### Screensharing

Carrot serves the ScreenCast portal itself and draws no chooser of its own,
so the share menu is whatever you want it to be. Every share request passes
one consent step:

- a **restore token** from an earlier share skips straight through,
- otherwise the configured **picker** command runs,
- with no picker configured, the next **left click** picks the window (or
  output) under the cursor - Escape or any other button cancels, and the
  click never reaches the app.

Casts follow their source off the visible workspace: a hidden window or
workspace keeps streaming, driven by its own commits.

The picker is any program: it receives one JSON candidate per line on stdin
and answers with the chosen `id` on stdout (empty output or exit without an
answer cancels the share).

```json
{"kind":"output","id":"o:DP-1","name":"DP-1","width":2560,"height":1440,"x":0,"y":0}
{"kind":"window","id":"w:42","app_id":"foot","title":"~","workspace":2}
{"kind":"workspace","id":"ws:2","index":2,"output":"DP-1","active":true}
```

Workspace entries are a carrot extra - sharing one follows the workspace
across outputs instead of pinning to a monitor. Theming lives entirely in
the picker program: a dmenu-style script works anywhere,

```kdl
general {
    picker "carrot-share-menu"
}
```

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# carrot-share-menu: candidates in, one id out
jq -r '[.id, .kind, (.name // .app_id // ""), (.title // "")] | @tsv' \
    | fuzzel --dmenu \
    | cut -f1
```

while a quickshell (or any shell) setup can forward the candidate list to
its own styled menu over IPC and print the id it picked. The picker path
never grabs the seat, so shell-drawn menus receive their clicks normally.

## Building

### With Nix

```sh
nix build github:carrot-wm/carrot
```

### With Cargo

```sh
cargo build --release
```

System dependencies: just `vulkan-loader` (dlopened at runtime, never linked) and a Vulkan driver (ICD) for your GPU. Carrot links **zero C** - no `libdrm`, `libinput`, `libseat`, `libxkbcommon`, or `libwayland`; the DRM, input, and session stacks are all hand-rolled over raw syscalls. `kbvm` parses an embedded default US keymap, so carrot boots with no XKB data on disk; it only reads `xkeyboard-config` when you configure a non-default layout, wired up automatically by the Nix build.

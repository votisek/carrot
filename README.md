# Carrot

A pure Rust tiling Wayland compositor with a Vulkan rendering pipeline. Carrot aims to be a feature-complete, all-in-one compositor with native support for blur, animations, multi-GPU, tearing, and more - no scripting or external tools needed.

> [!WARNING]
> Carrot is in extremely early development and is not yet usable. Any contributions, suggestions, or feedback are welcome.

## Complete List of Intended Features 

### Tiling
- **Dwindle layout** with directional focus, window swapping, and split ratio control
- **Window groups** (tabbed) with a styled groupbar
- **Floating layer** with mouse drag move/resize, centering, and PiP mode
- Fullscreen (real, bordered, and borderless), pin (visible on all workspaces)
- **Force float/tile per window** via window rules - no need for apps to behave

### Workspaces
- Numbered workspaces with relative navigation
- **Workspace groups** - sets of 10, navigable within and between groups
- **Special workspaces** (named scratchpads) with toggle-and-launch behavior

### Eye Candy
- Multi-pass **Kawase blur** with per-window and per-layer control
- **Drop shadows** with configurable falloff
- **Rounded corners**, per-window opacity, active/inactive borders
- **Animations** - custom bezier curves, spring physics, per-property config
  - Styles: slide, slidefadevert, popin, fade

### Window & Layer Rules
- Match by class, title, fullscreen state, xwayland, float (regex)
- Tons of effects: opacity, float, size, center, workspace assignment, immediate (tearing), idle inhibit, rounding, blur, shadow, dim, pin, keep aspect ratio
- **Focus steal control** - let specific apps actually grab focus when they ask for it, instead of just marking urgent
- **Input redirection** - route specific keys to unfocused/offscreen windows, with redirect (background only) or passthrough (both) modes
- Layer rules: animation overrides, blur, ignore alpha threshold

### Input
- Per-device mouse configuration (accel profile, sensitivity, natural scroll)
- Configurable keyboard repeat, layout, numlock
- Keybind types: press, lock-safe, repeat, release, mouse
- **Submaps** - switchable keybind contexts

### Performance & Gaming
- **Tearing** via `wp_tearing_control_v1` with per-window `immediate` rule
- **VRR** (adaptive sync) - off, automatic, or always, per-output
- **Direct scanout** bypass for fullscreen windows
- **Multi-GPU** - cross-GPU DMA-BUF import, blit and direct import paths, explicit sync, configurable renderer skip on secondary GPUs
- **Per-output GPU assignment** - render specific displays on a selectable GPUs (e.g. iGPU for laptop screen, eGPU for gaming monitor)

### IPC
- Custom JSON socket protocol (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/carrot/<instance>/`)
- Queries: active window, workspaces, workspace groups, special workspaces, monitors, clients
- Event stream: window open/close, focus, workspace changes, monitor hotplug, fullscreen, urgent
- Dispatcher commands over IPC (exec, workspace, focus, move, resize, kill, etc.)
- **Launch-to-workspace** - spawn windows on any workspace without the need of switching to it first

### Integration
- **XWayland** support via [xwayland-satellite](https://github.com/Supreeeme/xwayland-satellite)
- `ext-idle-notify-v1` for idle/lock management
- `wlr-layer-shell` for panels, overlays, and lock screens
- `wlr-foreign-toplevel-management` for taskbars and window switchers
- Screencopy for screenshots
- Clipboard via `zwlr_data_control_v1`
- DPMS wake on input

## Configuration

Carrot uses [KDL](https://kdl.dev) for configuration, with full NixOS and Home Manager module integration.

```kdl
general {
    layout "dwindle"
    allow-tearing true
    border-size 3
}

decoration {
    rounding 10
    blur {
        enabled true
        size 8
        passes 2
    }
    shadow {
        enabled true
        range 20
    }
}

animations {
    bezier "standard" 0.2 0.0 0.0 1.0

    animation "windowsIn" {
        enabled true
        speed 5
        curve "standard"
    }
}

window-rule {
    match class="steam_app_.*"
    immediate true
    idle-inhibit "always"
}

bind "Super" "Return" "exec" "foot"
```

<summary>NixOS / Home Manager</summary>

```nix
# flake.nix inputs
inputs.carrot.url = "github:flammablebunny/carrot";

# NixOS module
programs.carrot.enable = true;

# Home Manager module
wayland.windowManager.carrot = {
  enable = true;
  settings = {
    general = {
      layout = "dwindle";
      allow_tearing = true;
    };
    decoration = {
      rounding = 10;
      blur = { enabled = true; size = 8; passes = 2; };
    };
  };
};
```
